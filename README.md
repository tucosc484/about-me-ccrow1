<h2> 1.	What is your developer journey so far? What brought you to this major, and why did you take this class?</h2>
<p> I started coding in highschool for a technology credit, originally I wanted to act, but I fell in love with coding. I continued taking computer science classes in highschool and had the opprotunity to intern at a small startup based out of howard country called NextLOGik. There I spent most of my time doing QA, but I got to work on some SQL servers, and some basic web development. My web dev experience there was mostly HTML with C# backends, I learned some html and some bootstrapping while working there. Since then I have parted way with the company and now I work for general dynamics information technology, which used to be CSRA. I took this class out of interest in web development and design. I enjoy graphic design as a hobby so combining the two seems like a natural profression.<p>

<h2> 2.	What is your ideal career progression, if there were no limitations? </h2>

<p> I would like to move on past getting my BS and move on to get a minor or a major in biotechnonogy and work on bioprostetics. I would like to help create a cheap and functioning prostetic that could go on to assist veterans and people with disabilities help reaclimate to society after limb loss. For now I have to do what ever I can to get myself to the point of being able to achieve my goals. </p>

<h2> 3.	What programming experience do you have? Do you have any web experience?</h2>

<p> My main programming language is java, shocking right. I have experience in HTML, SQL, C#, XML, C, assembly, and python, but the only one that I would say I am proficent in is Java. Since working at CSRA I have become certified in Servicenow Administration for kingston and london patches. My web development experince is mostly QA, however I have done some design and development for web, I mentioned ealier that I have used bootstraping experience, I have designed a website using wordpress which you can find at (www.crowedu.com). </P>
